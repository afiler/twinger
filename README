Twinger is a finger gateway server that began with twitter support, but now also supports Facebook specifically and other sites generically.

For twitter, finger “<twitteruser>@twitter.com@<twingerhost>”, for Facebook, finger “cdc@facebook.com@finger.afiler.com”. Twinger also supports sites that have per-user RSS feeds linked to from the page at sitename.com/username (e.g. finger afiler@flickr.com@finger.afiler.com), and it supports queries on sites that have RSS feeds linked from their main page (e.g. finger afiler.com@finger.afiler.com).
